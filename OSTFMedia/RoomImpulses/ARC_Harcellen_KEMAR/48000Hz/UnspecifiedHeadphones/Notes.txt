Editing made from original IR files:
 2156 samples removed from beginning original files (moving start of 0 degrees IR to 0,004393939 seconds, representing 1.45 m in 330 m/s sound speed)
 faded in first 100 samples
 shortening the IRs to 8192 samples (0.17 s)
 fading out end (100 last samples)
 converting to 32 bit float sample format

(N.B. The file KEMAR_90_R.wav was originally exported from MATLAB in 32-bit format (to avoid clipping), while the others were exported in 24 bit format.)
